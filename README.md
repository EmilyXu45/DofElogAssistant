# Project Description:

### ✨ Streamlining the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award experience ✨

The DofE Log Assistant is a web-based platform designed to help students manage their progress and organize their requirements in one centralized location. Based on my own experiences, I understand that writing weekly logs can feel like a chore, often leading to a backlog of unrecorded entries. This tool eliminates that friction with automated organization and intelligent log generation, thereby turning a teduous task effortless.

## 📍Features:

### 1. 📊 Activities Tracker & Pre-Logger
Stop relying on memory when it comes to your official submission. Our tracker allows you to:
* **Log as you go:** Input activities daily so you don't forget the small details by the end of the week.
* **Ready for ORB:** Organize your notes into a clean format, making it a simple **copy-and-paste** job when you log onto the official Online Record Book (ORB).
* **Multi-Activity Support:** Easily categorize different tasks completed on different days.

### 2. 🤖 AI-Powered Activity Descriptions
Struggling to find the right words? Our smart prompter guides you through three critical reflective aspects:
* **Tasks Completed:** What did you actually do?
* **Learning Outcomes:** What new skills or insights did you gain?
* **Future Goals:** What are the next steps to reach your final objective?

> **Result:** You get an effective, reflective summary that meets DofE standards in a fraction of the time.

### 3. 📈 Automated Assessor Reports
Writing reports for dozens of students is tedious for assessors. This tool helps by:
* **Bulletpoint Summaries:** Generating a concise summary of a student's entire history.
* **Efficient Review:** Giving assessors a clear "head start" on what to write in the final report.
